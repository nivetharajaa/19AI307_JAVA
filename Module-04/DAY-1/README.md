# Ex.No:4(A)  JAVA CONSTRUCTOR
## AIM:
To create a Java program using clonstructor to print the circumference of rectangle.[l=5,w=6]

## ALGORITHM :
1.  1.	Start the Program.
2.	Define a class `circum`
3.	Inside the class, define two integer variables `l` and `w` with values 5 and 6, respectively
4.	Create a constructor `circum()`:
-	a) Calculate the `circumference` as `2 * (l + w)`
-	b) Print the `circumference` twice with different labels ("Area of First Rectangle" and "Area of Second Rectangle")
5.	In `main`, create an object `sc` of the `circum` class
6.	End





## PROGRAM:
